Your CV is **strong**, especially for entry-level or early-career roles, but to reach **Google-level jobs (‚Çπ40 LPA range)**, it needs a few targeted upgrades. Let‚Äôs break it down honestly and strategically üëá

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overall Impression

‚úÖ **Strengths**

* Strong technical foundation (React, Spring Boot, Docker, APIs).
* Excellent leadership & mentoring experience (teaching 100+ students).
* Project work with real-world tech stack (React + Node + Docker).
* Good extracurriculars (SIH finalist, hackathon experience).

‚ö†Ô∏è **Gaps for ‚Çπ40 LPA tier (Google / Tier-1 tech firms)**

* Missing **deep algorithmic / DSA focus** (key for Google).
* No mention of **system design or scalability** exposure.
* No **quantifiable project impact metrics** (e.g., latency reduced by X%, users served).
* Lacks **research or open-source credibility**.
* No **competitive programming or coding platform proof** (LeetCode, Codeforces, etc.).

---

## üéØ For Google / ‚Çπ40 LPA-Tier Readiness

Here‚Äôs what to strengthen:

### 1. **Add DSA & Problem-Solving Credentials**

Google screens heavily with DSA questions.

* Add: `LeetCode (500+ solved) | Codeforces (Expert)` or similar.
* If not there yet ‚Üí start practicing and mention ‚Äúsolving 5 DSA problems/day‚Äù as ongoing.

---

### 2. **Show Impact in Projects**

Convert each project to quantifiable impact:
**Before:**

> ‚ÄúBuilt real-time AI-assisted railway control system...‚Äù

**After:**

> ‚ÄúBuilt AI-assisted railway control system (React + Node + WebSockets) handling 200+ concurrent clients with <200 ms latency.‚Äù

That shows **scalability, performance, and measurable success** ‚Äî the metrics Google looks for.

---

### 3. **Add a Mini Section: ‚ÄúAlgorithmic & Research Interests‚Äù**

> **Research Interests:** Optimization, AI System Design, Data-Driven Automation
> **Competitive Programming:** LeetCode (300+), Codeforces (Specialist), CodeChef (3‚≠ê)

This gives a **signal of depth** beyond projects.

---

### 4. **Include an ‚ÄúAchievements in Tech Competitions‚Äù Line**

Add a one-liner like:

> ‚ÄúTop 1% performer in Google Kickstart 2025 / Code Jam (Round 2)‚Äù
> If not yet achieved ‚Äî you can prepare for Kickstart, Code Jam, or HackerRank competitions and add this later.

---

### 5. **Portfolio Upgrade**

Your portfolio link (`divyaprada.dev`) is a great plus ‚Äî make sure it has:

* Interactive demos of your projects.
* Code + Live link.
* Metrics (users, performance, technologies).
* A ‚ÄúTech Blog‚Äù or ‚ÄúLearning Journey‚Äù section ‚Äî Google values engineering communication.

---

### 6. **Certifications or Deep Skills**

Add one **solid specialization**:

* **Google Cloud Professional Engineer** *(or)*
* **Kubernetes Certified Associate (CKA)** *(or)*
* **ML specialization (Coursera ‚Äì Andrew Ng)**

That will push you toward the **‚Çπ40 LPA bracket** readiness.

### üí° What to Do Next (6-Month Action Plan)

1. **LeetCode daily** ‚Äì target 500+ questions.
2. **One large-scale system project** ‚Äì e.g., scalable chat app or microservice platform.
3. **Google Cloud / ML certification**.
4. **Open-source contribution** on GitHub.
5. **Apply to internships at Tier-1 product companies.**
